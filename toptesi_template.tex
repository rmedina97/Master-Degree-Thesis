\sommario%summary
In recent times, the introduction of edge/fog computing platforms, which operate on the principle of processing data in locations other than the central node (directly at the production node or at intermediate nodes), has enabled the development of monitoring systems and data consumption with greater speed and precision.

Within the context of the energy network, these platforms can be particularly suitable for the rapid (or automated) deployment of applications and services.

In fact, the geographically distributed compute infrastructure in combination with the transparency of virtualized (or cloud native) platforms opens up unprecedented flexibility for application deployment. 

Furthermore, they facilitate the implementation of new functionalities, for example to ensure the infrastructure's operation in case of disconnection from the backbone network. 

This is achieved by temporarily relocating essential software services locally and subsequently realigning the data with the remote "main" instance once the connection is restored (island mode operation). 

Based on the feasibility of local solutions using the Kubernetes platform in a distributed environment, this thesis presents a potential model to extend their edge/fog computing features to the entire electrical network, employing the innovative open-source project Liqo as the main technology for the management of the distributed cluster architecture.

In developing this model, significant emphasis was placed on ensuring a high degree of resilience. 

This was accomplished through the careful selection of a topology that not only supports the seamless integration of existing distributed database systems within a multi-cluster environment, without requiring any additional modifications, but it also provides the flexibility to distribute workload across any node, unrestricted by fixed architectural constraints but allowing the addition of logical constraints depending on the desired hierarchical architecture.

After examining the topology, the study progressed to creating a possible implementation in the domain of the electrical networks, analysing its behaviour in the event of faults and assessing its scalability. 

Comparing the obtained results with the initial solutions, the architecture adopted in this thesis demonstrates its capability to integrate and extend the local solution’s features to the entire network, without significant increases in latency despite the greater complexity. It also introduces new functionalities such as island mode operation, enabling separate management of the two network parts during disconnection and automatic resources reconciliation once the link is restored.

\ringraziamenti%acknowledgements
%Acknowledge the people you love and/or work with
I would like to dedicate this space to the people who, with their support, have helped me in this wonderful journey of deepening the knowledge acquired during my university years.

Led by my supervisor Risso, who, through his courses during my master's years, encouraged me to give my best and made me passionate about this course of study, even though it also brought some negative aspects, such as being forced to devise new low-tone curses in front of yet another bug during evening debugging sessions.

Owed to my co-supervisor Galantino, always present in times of need and consistently available to organize last-minute meetings despite his already busy schedule. I often wonder how he didn’t uninstall Slack after yet another message from me asking desperately for help.

Vital to my journey are my parents, who have always supported me in achieving my projects. From the very beginning, they believed in my potential and invested in my education, providing both moral and financial support. They were my pillars of strength during moments of discouragement, offering unwavering encouragement and advice that kept me focused on my goals. They celebrated my achievements as if they were their own, sharing in my joy and pride at every milestone. It is primarily thanks to their love, guidance, and sacrifices that I have reached this point. I could not have asked for better parents, and I am profoundly grateful for their constant presence and support throughout this journey.

Endlessly grateful to my little sister "Babbusè", with whom, despite our squabbles, I have shared so much, from the interminable and dreadful lunchtime TV series to our walks to stay fit.

Never forgetting my grandparents, who, in addition to making me experience the hardships of farm life (harvesting potatoes under the sun is a nightmare), managed to instill in me the values of humility intertwined with pride. I only regret not being able to celebrate with all of them.

I thank my housemates, with whom I have lived for years, experiencing adventures of all kinds and who found the strength to put up with me, despite trying to undermine my confidence in my cooking abilities. I especially thank Mina "Dove è Mikkel, no DOVE è Mikkel", who, besides instilling in me some musical culture, improved my discussion skills; Mich "Occhio alla testa", for the countless moral debates and numerous duo matches in FIFA; Pietro "Baba Piaga", who, besides leading me down the bad path of LoL, taught me how to cook much better.

Grateful to my friends Antonino "Scaffa The Legend", Attilio "CT Fioradoni Sbarra Tatanga", Davide "Hacker CBCR", Arianna "The 96 girl", and the other companions from my hometown for always being there and putting up with me until now.

Generously thanking all the people at Lab 9, as they created a peaceful workplace welcoming anyone who enters, even for someone as unsocial as me, and the people from RSE, always available and professional even during my terrible presentations.

Appreciating their understanding, I conclude with a hope for forgiveness regarding my preference for only my family at the ceremony. Additionally, I give an honorable mention to the song 'No rules!', which greatly aided in relieving stress over the past few months.
